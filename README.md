# static-website-in-aws-s3
- Deployment of a Static Website over AWS S3 needs no other resources to be included and it is fairly easy to deploy
- Before doing this, a proper knowledge of AWS S3 and AWS IAM is neccesary to understand the concepts and components better
- Firstly, we need the files required for the website such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, any attachments like images and videos
- After making the files and the codes ready, we can directly jump into AWS Management Console

# Steps to follow in AWS Management COnsole to make our website online
- Firstly, create an account on AWS (if you don't have one) and login to the AWS MAnagement console as a user
- Working on an IAM User account is better than working on a root account
- If you don't have an IAM account setup already, then go to IAM in AWS Management console in the root account
